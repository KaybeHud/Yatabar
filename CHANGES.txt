!! -  If you have used a earlier version, I recommend to delete the Yatabar.lua and Yatabar.lua.bak in your SavedVariables folder:
 ...World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\... search it in the subfolders, the place is maybe different on your computer
 
- show popups on keypress (set up key in config menu)
- add totemtimers
- changes savefile
