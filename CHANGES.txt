!! -  If you have used a version < 0.8, I recommend to delete the Yatabar.lua and Yatabar.lua.bak in your SavedVariables folder:
 ...World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\... search it in the subfolders, the place is maybe different on your computer


- add minimap icon
- remove timer when player is dead
- bugfix problem with setting orientation 

-----------------------
- show popups on keypress (set up key in config menu)
- add totemtimers
- changes savefile
